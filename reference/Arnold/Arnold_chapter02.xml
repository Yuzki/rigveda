    CHAPTER  II. 
    THE   POPULAR  RIGVEDA. 
    </head>

    <p n="71">
    71.  The  '  popular  Rigveda '  consists  of  hymns  which  contain 
    about  one-sixth  part  of  the  matter  of  the  Rigveda,  and  are  marked 
    out  from  the  remainder  by  differences  of  language,  metre,  and 
    subject,  and  by  their  position  in  the  collection.  Of  these  hymns 
    a  large  proportion  are  repeated  in  the  first  nineteen  books  of  the 
    Atharvaveda,  often  with  slight  differences  in  the  arrangement  of 
    the  stanzas  and  in  phraseology :  and  in  their  general  character 
    these  hymns  can  hardly  be  distinguished  from  the  remaining  verse 
    portions  of  the  Atharvaveda.

73.  In  srme  hymns  and  fragments  a  doubt  arises  as  to 
whether  they  should  be  referred  to  the  popular  Rigveda  or  not, 
either  because  the  characteristic  features  of  the  two  groups  of 
hymns  are  mixed,  or  because  they  are  almost  or  entirely  wanting. 


Doubtful  hymns  23 

Although  hymns  of  this  kind  are  on  the  whole  fairly  numerous, 
yet  relatively  they  form  only  a  small  part  of  the  Rigveda,  and  do 
not  affect  the  broad  contrast  between  the  two  groups. 

The  difficulties  that  occur  differ  in  kind  according  as  they 
affect  large  or  small  amounts  of  matter. 

In  the  case  of  long  hymns  and  collections  of  hymns  characteristic 
features  must  necessarily  occur  with  fair  frequency,  and  difficulty 
only  arises  when  the  features  of  the  opposite  groups  are  found  in 
the  same  hymn  or  collection.  In  such  cases  the  general  inference 
must  be  that  the  hymn  or  collection  belongs  to  a  transition  period, 
as  for  instance  the  collections  i  31 — 35,  i  94 — 115,  and  those  which 
extend  generally  from  x  35  to  x  84,  which  we  have  already  assigned 
to  the  ■  cretic '  period  (§  61).  Here  the  only  real  doubt  is  whether 
the  transition  period  lies  nearer  to  the  one  or  the  other  of  the  two 
main  groups:  and  this  question  is  clearly  one  which  should  be 
reserved  to  a  late  stage  of  our  enquiry. 

But  in  the  case  of  short  hymns,  and  still  more  in  that  of 
detached  verses,  characteristic  features  may  be  altogether  wanting, 
or  so  scanty  as  to  give  room  for  the  play  of  chance.  If  however  we 
can  group  together  in  any  way  these  shorter  hymns  and  fragments, 
it  is  possible  that  a  general  character  will  come  to  light  in  the 
group  as  a  whole.  For  example,  the  single  Tristubh  stanzas 
appended  to  many  hymns,  taken  together,  resemble  in  character 
the  Rigveda  proper :  whereas  the  corresponding  Anustubh  stanzas 
resemble  the  popular  Rigveda.  Such  generalizations  are  often  of 
use  in  determining  roughly  the  position  of  the  single  stanzas, 
although  the  inference  may  not  be  finally  justified  in  certain 
cases. 

In  drawing  up  a  definitive  list  of  the  hymns  of  the  '  popular 
Rigveda,'  we  are  going  further  than  our  general  theory,  strictly 
understood,  permits  us.  In  the  first  place  the  two  groups  of 
hymns  are  not  sharply  divided,  but  overlap.  In  the  second  place 
the  evidence  available,  when  analyzed,  consists  of  probabilities 
only:  and  though  the  concurrence  of  many  probabilities  con- 
stitutes historical  certainty,  this  concurrence  is  not  existent  in 
all  details. 

Against  this  theoretical  objection  must  be  set  the  great 
practical  convenience  of  a  definitive  list,  in  which  the  errors 
can  only  be  relatively  few.  In  order  to  deal  with  the  doubtful 
hymns  it  will  be  desirable  to  review  the  evidence  available. 


24  The  linguistic  evidence 

74.  First  in  practical  importance  stand  divergences  of  language, 
in  which  we  include  both  grammar  and  vocabulary.  These  are  so 
numerous  that  there  are  few  stanzas  in  the  Rigveda  which  do  not 
contain  one  or  two :  and  though  the  evidence  of  a  small  number 
of  instances  is  not  final,  yet  it  is  of  great  value  in  giving  in  almost 
all  cases  a  first  presumption  as  to  the  class  to  which  a  hymn 
belongs.  In  §§  84 — 87  will  be  found  lists  of  the  distinctive 
linguistic  features  of  each  class  of  hymns,  drawn  up  upon 
principles  which  are  mainly  mechanical,  and  therefore  free  from 
the  influence  of  personal  bias,  though  subject  in  detail  to  the 
occasional  play  of  chance :  and  in  the  '  Table  of  Hymns '  will 
be  found  stated  the  number  of  instances  of  each  kind  to  be 
found  in  the  hymns  and  stanzas,  so  far  as  it  is  necessary  to 
treat  them  separately.  It  remains  to  consider  how  much  im- 
portance can  be  attached  to  this  kind  of  evidence  in  individual 
cases. 

75.  An  examination  of  the  distinctive  grammatical  forms  as 
a  whole  shews  us  that  the  hymns  of  the  Rigveda  proper  record  an 
earlier  stage  in  the  developement  of  the  Sanskrit  language ;  for 
they  shew  that  multiplicity  of  form  in  the  stem-formation  and 
flexion  both  of  nouns  and  verbs  which  marks  the  earlier  history 
of  all  Indo-European  languages.  The  unthematic  flexional  forms 
of  nouns,  and  the  extended  use  of  the  perfect,  aorist,  subjunctive, 
and  infinitive  systems  in  verbs  are  particularly  conspicuous.  On 
the  other  hand  the  language  of  the  popular  hymns,  though  enriched 
by  certain  sounds  hardly  known  to  the  Rigveda  proper,  shews  a 
tendency  to  uniformity,  obtained  by  the  steady  progress  of  certain 
favoured  types  in  destroying  or  assimilating  their  rivals. 

76.  The  differences  of  vocabulary  lead  directly  to  a  somewhat 
different  conclusion.  Here  divergence  of  style  and  subject-matter 
seem  more  prominent.  Amongst  the  '  popular '  words  are  a  great 
number  of  Indo-European  origin  which  must  certainly  have  been 
familiar  to  the  poets  of  the  '  Rigveda  proper/  though  seldom  used 
by  them,  having  to  do  with  the  familiar  objects  and  activities  of 
ordinary  life.  Hence  we  are  led  to  the  contrast  between  the 
'  heroic '  and  the  '  popular '  language,  and  to  the  possibility  that 
both  may  have  been  simultaneously  in  use  for  different  purposes. 
Other  words,  however,  support  the  inference  of  earlier  date  already 
drawn  from  the  grammatical  forms:    nor  is  it   possible  to  draw 


The  metrical  evidence  25 

a  line  between  the  two  classes,  which  are  in  practice  associated  in 
all  the  hymns  in  which  they  occur. 

77.  As  older  words  and  forms  may  appear  in  later  hymns 
either  by  direct  imitation  of  particular  models  or  by  the  un- 
conscious effect  of  literary  tradition,  so  the  '  popular '  words  at 
least  may  find  a  place  in  the  older  hymns  under  the  influence  of 
some  special  subject-matter,  and  even  later  words  and  forms  by 
anticipation  of  linguistic  developements  not  yet  established  in 
literature.  Amongst  ourselves  '  Bible '  phraseology  is  still  found 
in  much  current  literature,  whilst  our  lexicographers  find  many 
so-called  'American'  neoterisms  in  early  English  records.  In 
particular  passages  a  minute  criticism  of  the  separate  words  and 
forms  can  lead  to  no  practical  result:  and  therefore  in  doubtful 
cases  linguistic  evidence  seems  to  be  of  comparatively  small 
importance.  But  in  judging  of  large  quantities  of  matter  its 
cumulative  weight  is  considerable ;  and  this  appears  to  make  it 
certain  that  as  a  whole  the  popular  Rigveda  is  really  of  later  date. 

78.  The  evidence  of  metre  is,  on  the  whole,  more  cogent  than 
that  of  language :  for  though  the  external  form  of  older  hymns 
may  be  occasionally  imitated  later,  yet  this  would  seem  to  be 
impossible  as  regards  the  rhythm :  for  the  younger  poet  either 
did  not  appreciate  the  rhythms  used  by  his  predecessors,  or  desired 
to  improve  them.  The  characteristic  metres  of  the  popular  Rigveda 
have  been  described,  viz.  the  'epic'  Anustubh  in  all  its  stages 
(§  41),  and  the  '  contamination  '  of  Tristubh  metre  by  JagatI  (§  54). 
In  Anustubh  verse  a  single  occurrence  of  a  long  7th  syllable  in 
1  semi -cadence '  is  a  decided  indication  of  popular  character,  whilst 
the  absence  of  a  short  3rd  syllable  in  several  successive  'reopenings' 
is  almost  as  significant.  On  the  other  hand  too  much  stress  must 
not  be  laid  on  single  instances  of  contamination  in  trimeter  verse, 
for  these  are  not  uncommon  in  the  hymns  assigned  to  the  'cretic' 
period. 

There  seems  every  reason  to  suppose  that  the  metres  of  the 
popular  Rigveda  are  directly  derived  from  those  of  the  Rigveda 
proper,  and  consequently  of  later  date. 

79.  The  repetition  of  a  complete  hymn  or  fragment,  or  even 
of  any  part  of  it  beyond  one  stanza,  in  the  Atharvaveda  is  a  strong 
indication  of  the  later  date.     It  appears  from  the  list  in  §  72  that 


26  The  evidence  of  subject-matter 

more  than  one  half  of  the  hymns  which  clearly  belong  to  the 
popular  Rigveda  are  repeated  with  more  or  less  completeness  in 
the  Atharvaveda:  whilst  of  those  hymns  which  clearly  belong  to 
the  Rigveda  proper  only  about  a  dozen  are  repeated,  except  by 
the  quotation  of  single  stanzas,  viz.  i  22  16 — 18,  19 — 11,  32,  50 
1—9,  154;  iv  2;  v  46  7 — 8;  vi  68  10— n  ;  vii  32;  viii  24;  x  40. 
Single  stanzas  are  drawn  by  the  Atharvaveda  from  all  parts  of  the 
Rioveda,  but  the  repetition  of  such  stanzas  in  the  Atharvaveda 
is  still  of  some  weight,  especially  if  they  appear  in  the  Rigveda  to 
be  detached  from  their  context. 

80.  To  the  position  of  hymns  and  fragments  in  the  Samhita 
text  considerable  importance  is  to  be  attached.  As  we  observe 
that  the  hymns  which  plainly  belong  to  the  popular  Rigveda  are 
almost  all  found  in  certain  positions,  namely  at  the  end  of 
complete  collections,  or  of  the  Agni  or  Indra  sections  of  those 
collections,  or  in  the  tenth  Mandala :  it  follows  that  we  are  likely 
to  find  other  hymns  of  the  same  character  similarly  placed.  Hymns 
which  disturb  the  mechanical  arrangement  of  each  collection  also 
deserve  careful  examination.  With  regard  to  that  arrangement 
it  will  be  sufficient  to  refer  to  the  full  discussion  by  Professor 
H.  Oldenberg  (Prolegomena,  Chapter  11)  as  a  starting  point :  but 
it  must  be  kept  in  mind  that  many  of  the  oldest  hymns  in  the 
Rigveda  are  found  either  out  of  the  order  or  in  the  tenth  Mandala, 
as  is  conclusively  shewn  by  the  language  and  metre. 

81.  It  is  only  when  other  indications  fail  that  a  consideration 
of  the  subject-matter  of  the  poems  becomes  necessary.  There  is 
clearly  a  presumption  that  '  hymns '  in  the  strict  sense,  that  is 
poems  in  which  the  praise  of  the  gods  is  the  primary  object,  belong 
to  the  Rigveda  proper :  but  this  presumption  fails  when  the  deity 
is  not  known  to  or  not  homogeneous  with  the  Pantheon  of  the 
Rigveda.  So  there  is  a  presumption  that  '  charms,'  that  is  poems 
in  which  the  profit  of  the  suppliant  or  the  harming  of  his  enemy 
is  the  primary  object,  belong  to  the  popular  Rigveda :  but  even 
amongst  the  early  hymns  we  find  a  few  in  which  relief  from  pains 
of  conscience  or  disease  is  the  main  theme.  Mythological  narra- 
tions and  dramatic  dialogues  are  not  entirely  wanting  in  the 
Rigveda  proper,  though  they  are  much  more  common  later :  whilst 
the  converse  appears  to  be  true  of  poems   with  liturgical  and 


The  evidence  of  subject-matter  27 

ceremonial  subjects.     Philosophical  and  cosmogonical  poems,  and 
those  which  contain  proverbs  or  riddles,  are  generally  late. 

82.  To  discuss  at  any  length  the  evidence  affecting  particular 
hymns  would  exceed  the  scope  of  this  book,  but  there  will  be 
found  in  §  88  a  list  of  all  those  hymns  of  the  Rigveda  with  regard 
to  which  reasonable  doubt  seems  to  exist:  and  an  asterisk  is 
prefixed  to  those  which  appear  to  be  more  properly  assigned  to 
the  popular  Rigveda.  The  evidence  of  language  and  metre  is 
given  in  the  '  Table  of  Hymns  'at  the  end  of  this  book,  and  this 
table  should  also  be  consulted  in  each  case. 

In  those  cases  in  which  the  evidence  is  not  quite  sufficient  to 
justify  us  in  assigning  a  hymn  to  the  papular  Rigveda,  it  will 
generally  be  probable  that  it  is  not  very  much  earlier  in  date,  and 
therefore  that  we  may  have  reason  to  refer  it  later  to  some  period 
other  than  that  of  the  earliest  literature,  that  is,  either  to  the 
*  normal '  or  the  '  ere  tic '  period. 


APPENDIX   I. 

THE  LINGUISTIC  EVIDENCE  OF  DATE. 

83.     Notes. 

The  lists  given  in  the  following  sections  84 — 87  are  drawn  up  upon 
the  mechanical  principles  described  by  the  author  in  Kuhrvs  Zeitschrift 
N.  F.  xvii  4,  pp.  436,  437,  and  give  in  a  corrected  and  amplified  form 
the  lists  on  pp.  440 — 452  in  the  same  article. 

References  to  the  occurrences  in  the  Rigveda  are  only  given  when 
they  are  not  readily  accessible  in  such  works  as  Grassmann's  Worter- 
buch  zum  Rigveda,  Lanman's  Noun- Inflection  in  the  Veda,  and  Avery's 
Verb- Inflection  in  Sanskrit. 

The  Valakhilya  hymns  are  counted  as  hymns  belonging  to  the 
eighth  Mandala,  that  is,  as  viii  49 — 59  inclusive.  Consequently  the 
remaining  hymns  of  the  Mandala  are  counted  as  viii  60 — 103,  not  as 
viii  49 — 92.  This  reckoning  agrees  with  Aufrecht's  second  edition  of 
the  Rigveda  (Bonn,  1877),  and  with  Max  Miiller's  editions  and  Index, 

An  asterisk  *  is  prefixed  to  all  references  to  passages  in  the  popular 
Rigveda.  An  asterisk  prefixed  to  a  word  or  form  denotes  that  it  is 
found  in  the  popular  Rigveda  only. 

A  dagger  f  marks  occurrences  which  depend  upon  correction  of 
the  text. 

Words  and  forms  are  accented  when  any  of  the  occurrences  are 
accented. 

In  lists  of  compounds  the  Pada-patha  forms  are  often  given  for 
convenience  of  tabulation. 

In  reckoning  the  number  of  occurrences  Aufrecht's  printed  text  is 
followed,  so  that  the  refrain  stanzas  and  verses  which  are  found  in 
many  hymns  are  as  a  rule  only  counted  once.  Where  one  or  more 
verses  are  repeated  many  times  in  a  single  hymn,  three  occurrences  are 
reckoned. 

The  forms  connected  with  metrical  restoration  are  omitted  here,  as 
the  subject  is  treated  in  the  later  chapters  of  this  book.

metre  :  viz.  asdnl,  navati,  ndvyasl,  prdmati,  saptati,  sumati,  hiranydyi ; 
for  the  occurrences  see  §  139  iii.

APPENDIX   II. 
88.     List  of  doubtful  hymns  and  fragments. 

Mand,ala  I. 

13  9-12.  The  second  section  of  the  Apriya  hymns,  both  here  and 
elsewhere,  contains  late  linguistic  features  :  but  only  in  ix  5  *8— n 
do  we  find  either  of  the  characteristic  metres  of  the  popular  Rigveda. 

22  i6-j8.     Stanzas  17,  18  are  repeated  AY.  vii  26  4,  5. 

22  19-21.     Stanzas  19,  20  are  repeated  AV.  vii  26  6,  7. 

*24  1,  2.  These  stanzas  seem  to  have  the  character  of  a  charm  : 
much  depends  on  the  interpretation  of  the  phrase  pitdram  ca  matdram 
ca,  for  which  parallels  are  found  in  *i  163  13b,  viii  69  15d,  ix  73 
5a,  *x  88  15d,  those  in  the  popular  Rigveda  being  the  nearer.  For 
the  form  of  question  and  answer  compare  *v  44  14,  15. 

*24  6-15.  The  linguistic  indications  receive  some  confirmation 
from  slight  contamination  in  15c.  Part  of  stanza  9  is  repeated  AV. 
vi  97  2,  and  stanza  15  in  AV.  vii  83  3. 

27  13.     Uncertain:  cf.  i  139  11,     iii  9  9. 

28  1-6.  The  metre  shews  some  trace  of  epic  rhythm,  and  the 
linguistic  notes  indicate  late  date.  On  the  other  hand  it  is  difficult  to 
separate  these  stanzas  from  7-9,  which  are  similar  in  their  subject:  and 
the  whole  hymn  may  therefore  be  assigned  to  the  transition  period. 

29.  This  hymn  has  to  some  extent  the  character  of  a  charm ;  it 
can  hardly  be  earlier  than  the  transition  period,  and  like  28  1-6,  is 
possibly  later. 

32.     Stanzas  1-3  are  quoted  AV.  ii  5  5-7. 

35.  This  hymn,  if  standing  by  itself,  would  naturally  be  referred 
to  the  popular  Rigveda  in  consequence  of  its  metre  :  but  it  can  hardly 
be  separated  from  the  other  hymns  of  its  group. 

50  1-9.     Quoted  AV.  xiii  2  16-24. 

*84  16-18.  Out  of  order,  and  not  of  the  character  of  a  hymn. 
Stanza  16  quoted  AV.  xviii  1  6. 


42  Doubtful  hymns 

*89  10.     Fragment  of  a  cosmogony,  quoted  AY.  vii  6  i. 

*90  9.     Appended  Anustubh  stanza,  quoted  AY.  xix  9  6. 

*93.  The  metre  of  1-3  may  be  epic  Anustubh,  and  4-8  is  out  of 
order,  besides  shewing  contamination.  The  combination  of  Agni  and 
Soma  is  so  strange  to  the  Rigveda  proper  that  it  is  probable  that  the 
whole  hymn  is  late. 

*97.  This  appears  to  be  of  the  nature  of  a  charm  :  stanzas  1-8 
are  quoted  AY.  iv  33  1-8. 

105  1-3.     Stanza  1  quoted  AY.  xviii  4  89. 

105  16-18.     Stanza  16  shews  a  trace  of  epic  rhythm. 

115.  Stanza  1  is  quoted  AY.  xiii  2  35  :  but  the  hymn  can  hardly 
be  separated  from  the  other  hymns  of  its  group.     Compare  i  35. 

*120  10-12.  The  character  of  this  fragment  is  very  uncertain  : 
it  disturbs  the  order  of  the  hymns. 

*126  6,  7.     Appended  Anustubh  stanzas. 

*  133  1-5.  These  stanzas  have  the  character  of  a  charm  :  but  it  is 
very  unusual  to  find  such  verses  prefixed  to  one  of  the  hymns  of  the 
ordered  collection. 

139  11.     Uncertain:  cf.  i  27  13. 

*161.  A  typical  mythological  hymn,  assigned  to  the  late  Rigveda 
on  linguistic  grounds. 

♦170,  *179.     See  on  i  *161. 

188  8-11.     See  on  i  13  9-12. 

Mandala  II. 

3  8-1 1.     See  on  i  13  9-12. 

*8  6.  The  metre  may  be  interpreted  either  as  Gayatri  with  extra 
verse  or  as  epic  Anustubh,  but  the  association  of  Indra  and  Soma  with 
Agni  is  contrary  to  the  practice  of  the  Rigveda,  and  the  nearest  parallel 
is  perhaps  in  the  popular  hymn  *x  173  5c  6a. 

*32  4,  5.     Quoted  AV.  vii  48  1,  2. 

39,  40.  The  linguistic  notes  indicate  late  date,  but  this  is  un- 
confirmed, and  it  seems  better  to  assign  the  hymns  to  the  same  group 
as  i  35,  115. 

Mandala  III. 

*8  10,  11.  This  fragment  has  late  linguistic  notes,  and  disturbs 
the  order  of  the  hymns. 

9  9.     Uncertain  (compare  i  27  13),  but  required  here  by  the  order. 
*28.     Out  of  order,  and  similar  in  metre  to  the  next'  hymn.     Cf. 
also  iii  52. 

*29.  In  spite  of  the  linguistic  notes,  the  general  character  of  this 
hymn,  the  traces  of  epic  Anustubh  metre,  and  the  fact  that  stanza  10 
is  partly  repeated  in  AY.  iii  20  1,  and  stanza  16  is  repeated  AY.  vii 
97  1,  all  contribute  to  mark  it  as  belonging  to  the  popular  Rigveda. 


Doubtful  hymns  43 

33  1— 12.     Uncertain  :  cf.  iii  53  9-16. 

*33  13.     Appended  Anustubh  stanza,  repeated  AV.  xiv  2  16. 

*37  ir.     Appended  Anustubh  stanza. 

*52.  This  hymn  is  out  of  order,  and  being  closely  parallel  to  iii  28, 
is  probably  a  late  addition. 

53  1.  An  independent  hymn,  in  its  proper  order  as  one  of  the 
Indra  hymns. 

53  2-16.  A  series  of  fragments,  as  to  which  it  is  only  clear  that 
they  are  of  the  same  period  as  iii  33  1-12,  which  also  deals  with  the 
personality  of  VisVamitra.     Cf.  vi  47  1-25. 

53  24.     Appended  Tristubh  verse. 


Mand,ala  IV. 

12  6.     Uncertain  :  cf.  i  27  13,     iii  9  9.     Repeated  x  126  8. 

*13  5.     Apparently  a  fragment  of  a  cosmogony  :  cf.  i  *89  10. 

24  *9  *io.  These  verses  form  no  part  of  the  hymn  :  their  meaning 
is  much  disputed,  but  they  seem  to  have  the  character  of  the  popular 
hymns.     Cf.  i  *120  10-12. 

*39  6.     Appended  Anustubh  stanza. 

42  1-7.  A  mythological  dialogue,  which  appears  to  belong  to  the 
Rigveda  proper. 

57  1-3.  This  hymn  is  not  out  of  order,  and  by  its  analogy  with 
the  hymns  to  Brhaspati,  Sadaspati,  and  Vastospati  belongs  to  the 
Rigveda  proper. 

*58.  The  position  of  this  hymn  is  the  principal  reason  for  assign- 
ing it  to  the  popular  Rigveda  rather  than  to  the  cretic  period,  with 
which  it  is  connected  by  subject  and  language.  Stanza  10  is  repeated 
AV.  vii  82  1.  Stanza  11  may  be  regarded  as  a  contamination  of  the 
Tristubh  metre,  or  it  may  be  an  appended  stanza.     Cf.  x  *94,  *175. 


Mandala  V. 

5  8-1 1.     See  on  i  13  9-12. 

*30  15.  The  reference  to  the  Pravargya  ceremony  is  isolated  in 
the  Rigveda,  and  may  indicate  later  date. 

40  4.     Appended  Tristubh  stanza. 

*44  14,  15.     The  metre  indicates  late  date. 

46  7,  8.     Repeated  AY.  vii  49  1,  2. 

*51  14,  15.     Appended  Anustubh  stanzas. 

61  6-8.  The  language,  and  perhaps  the  subject,  may  indicate  later 
date. 

62.     The  language  indicates  late  date,  but  this  is  unsupported. 

78  4.     Appended  Tristubh  stanza. 

*83.     Verse  7a  repeated  AV.  iv  15  6a  :  stanza  8  AV.  iv  15  16. 


44  Doubtful  hymns 


Mandala  VI. 

9.     The  language  alone  indicates  late  date :  cf.  ii  39,  40,     v  62. 

15  i6-r8.  These  stanzas  appear  to  form  a  separate  hymn,  rightly 
placed  in  the  arrangement. 

*15  19.     Out  of  order,  and  late  by  the  linguistic  notes. 

*16  47,  48.     Appended  Anustubh  stanzas. 

47  1-25.  This  hymn  consists  of  a  number  of  fragments,  all  of 
which  are  out  of  order  in  the  collection,  though  they  seem  to  be 
roughly  arranged  amongst  themselves.  The  first  three  fragments  are 
really  separate  hymns,  viz.  1-5  (Soma),  6—10  (Indra),  11—14  (Indra) : 
they  shew  no  indication  of  late  date,  except  that  several  stanzas  are 
repeated  elsewhere,  namely  1  in  AV.  xviii  1  48,  6  AV.  vii  76  6,  8 
AV.  xix  15  4,  11  AV.  vii  86  i,  12-13  RV.  x  131  6,  7,  and  AV. 
vii  91  1,  92  1.  It  does  not  seem  clear  that  these  hymns  belong  to  the 
popular  Rigveda.  On  the  other  hand  stanzas  15-18  are  late  by  metre 
and  language,  but  do  not  appear  in  AV.  :  stanzas  19,  20,  21  give  no 
certain  indications,  and  stanzas  22-25  appear  rather  to  be  early  in 
character. 

*48  22.     Appended  Anustubh  stanza  :  cosmogonical. 

*51  r6.     Appended  Anustubh  stanza. 

*52  1-3.  Stanza  2  repeated  AV.  ii  12  6.  If  stanzas  1-3  are  a 
later  addition,  the  remainder  of  the  hymn  is  in  its  proper  order. 

52  4-6.     Uncertain. 

53-57.  The  Pusan  group  shews  a  large  proportion  of  the  popular 
linguistic  notes,  especially  54,  of  which  stanzas  9,  10  are  repeated 
AV.  vii  9  3,  4. 

60  14,  15.     Uncertain. 

72.     The  metre  alone  indicates  late  date. 

Mandala  VII. 

2  8— 11.  The  metre  indicates  that  these  stanzas  really  belong  to 
iii  4,  which  see. 

17.  This  hymn  is  a  play  upon  an  Apriya  hymn  of  seven  verses, 
such  as  vii  1  1—7.    Although  out  of  order,  it  does  not  appear  to  be  late. 

*33.     Mythological  poem. 

*35.  Uncertain:  stanzas  1-10  are  repeated  AV.  xix  10  1-10 ; 
stanzas  11-15  in  AV.  xix  11  1-5. 

41.      Uncertain  :  repeated  AV.  iii  16  1-7. 

*49.     Uncertain :  stanza  3  repeated  AV  i  33  2. 

55  1.     Compare  the  preceding  hymn,  and  iv  57  1-3. 

*55  2-4.     Apparently  a  charm,  but  the  metre  is  lyric :  cf.  x  126. 

59  7,  8.     Stanza  8  repeated  AV.  vii  77  2. 

59  9-1 1.     Out  of  order.      Stanza  9  repeated  AV.  vii  77  1. 

*Q6  16.     Unmetrical  and  probably  late. 


Doubtful  hymns  45 

89  5.     Repeated  AV.  vi  51  3. 

101,    102.     The   Parjanya   hymns  shew  late  linguistic   notes,  but 
they  are  in  their  order  in  the  collection. 


Mandala  VIII. 

*1  33.     Out  of  place,  and  with  late  linguistic  notes. 

*1  34.     Mythological. 

*3  24.  Appended  cosmogonical  verse.  The  metre  is  probably 
Pankti. 

*33  16-18.     Perhaps  late  :  but  cf.  v  61  6-8. 

*33  19.     Appended  Anustubh  stanza  :  mythological. 

47  1-12.     Uncertain. 

*47  13-18.  The  language  and  the  epic  rhythm  in  15c  17d  point  to 
late  date.     Stanza  17  is  repeated  AV.  vi  46  3,     xix  57  1. 

*48.     The  metre  seems  to  indicate  late  date. 

*59  1—5.  The  position  of  this  hymn  between  two  others  that  are 
clearly  late,  suggests  late  date. 

*66  15.     Appended  Anustubh  stanza. 

69.  This  hymn  contains  some  elements  of  uncertainty:  verse  11a 
shews  epic  rhythm  :  for  the  phrase  pitre  mdtre  see  on  i  24  1,  2. 

*100.  In  the  section  7-9  the  metre,  in  10-11  the  subject  plainly 
indicate  late  date.  In  the  other  sections  the  probabilities  are  on  the 
same  side. 

*101  14.     Cosmogonical  stanza,  repeated  AV.  x  8  3. 

*101  15,  16.     Probably  late,  as  following  stanza  14. 

*102  19-21.     Probably  late  :  stanza  20  is  repeated  AV.  xix  64  3. 

*102  22.     Probably  late,  as  following  stanzas  19-21. 

Mandala  X. 

2.     Stanzas  3,  4  are  repeated  AV.  xix  59  3,  2. 

9  1-5.     Repeated  AV.  i  5  1—3,  6  1,  54. 

*11-13.  Hymns  11,  12  are  repeated  in  their  entirety  in  AV. 
xviii  1,  and  hymn  13  is  repeated  in  AV.  xviii  3  39-41,  vii  57  2. 
There  are  also  other  marks  of  agreement  in  the  collection  10—14  which 
make  it  undesirable  to  separate  its  parts,  though  it  is  probable  that 
some  fragments  of  earlier  date  are  included  in  it. 

*27,  *28.  The  dialogue  form  contributes  to  make  late  date 
probable. 

*32  6-9.     Mythological  poem  (Agni  in  the  waters). 

40.     Stanzas  10,  12,  13  repeated  AV.  xiv  1  46,  2  5,  6. 

*51-53.     Mythological  poems  (Agni  and  the  gods). 

54-56  3.  Uncertain.  The  stanza  55  5  is  repeated  AV.  ix  10  9, 
and  56  1  in  AV.  xviii  3  7. 


46  Doubtful  hymns 

*59  1-4,  *60  1-6.  In  the  absence  of  more  definite  indications 
these  hymns  may  be  presumed  to  be  of  the  same  late  date  as  those 
attached  to  them. 

62.     Uncertain. 

*87  22-25.  The  position  amongst  hymns  clearly  popular  makes 
late  date  probable. 

*94.  The  date  of  this  ceremonial  hymn,  as  of  *iv  58,  *x  175,  is 
open  to  some  doubt. 

*95.     Mythological  poem  (Pururavas  and  Urvasi). 

*101,  *102.  These  hymns  must  be  considered  together,  owing  to 
the  similarity  of  position  and  metre.  Late  date  is  indicated  by  the 
repetition  of  101  3,  4  in  AV.  iii  17  2,  1,  and  by  the  mythological 
subject  of  102. 

*108.     Mythological  poem. 

110  x-ir.  Apriya  hymn,  repeated  AV.  v  12  i-u.  See  on  i  13 
9-12. 

*119.     Out  of  order.     Decisive  indications  of  date  are  wanting. 

*120.     Repeated  AV.  v  2. 

123.  Stanza  6  is  repeated  AY.  xviii  3  66. 

124.  This  hymn  as  a  whole  is  out  of  order.  Stanzas  *1 — 5 
containing  the  dialogue  between  Indra  and  Agni  appear  to  be  late. 
On  the  other  hand  the  Vrtra  myth  in  stanzas  6-8  has  the  signs  of 
early  date.  For  the  'swan'  myth  in  stanza  *9  close  analogies  are 
wanting,  but  it  is  more  probably  late. 

127.     Uncertain  :  for  the  subject  cf.  v  61  17-19. 
*139  1—3.     Uncertain  :  stanza  3  is  repeated  AV.  x  8  42. 
*139  4-6.     Mythological  poem. 
*141.     The  metre  indicates  late  date. 
*142  1-6.     Uncertain. 

*149.     Uncertain:  verse  2c  suggests  contamination. 
*153.      Uncertain  :  the  position  favours  late  date. 
*157.     Mythological  poem  (slaying  of  the  Asuras). 
*167.     The  dialogue  form  suggests  late  date. 

*168.     For  the  subject  cf.  *x  146 :  verse  2c  suggests  contamination. 
*170.     The  reference  to  the  slaying  of  the  Asuras  suggests  late 
date:  cf.  *x  157. 

*175.     See  on  *x  94. 

*179.     Repeated  AV.  vii  72. 

♦180.     Stanzas  2,  3  are  repeated  AV.  vii  84  3,  2. 

185.  The  metre  suggests  early  date  :  but  the  position  makes  this 
doubtful. 

*187.     Repeated  AV.  vi  34. 

*191  1.  Repeated  AV.  vi  63  4.  The  position  confirms  the 
presumption  of  late  date.
